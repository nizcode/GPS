# GPS - analysis
=======================================

### This repository includes 3 scripts:

### HMLcal.R - calculates the EnergyConsumtion (EC) for any acceleration
Multiply EC by v to get Metabolic Load
Formula is based of the theoritcal model researched in http://www.carlocapelli.it/ftp/didattica/Specialistica/Bibliografia/Sprint_running/Osgnach%20et%20al_MSSE_2010.pdf 

============================================================================

### Intensity.R - Intensity research on training/matches
In this scripts starts with some basic feature enginearing, then It goes into the intenisty calculations\
Intensity is measured via High Metabolic Load Distance per min\
The script can do:\
1. Measure max intensity for given time preiod
2. get the time ath which max intenisty occured
3. Graph intensities for the duration of game/training
4. Analyse and compare with barchart the intensity for different time intervals ie, HMLD/1min, HMLD/10min
